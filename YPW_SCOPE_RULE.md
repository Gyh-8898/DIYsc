# YPW Scope Rule

1. All code changes, scripts, and run commands must target only: `C:\Users\Y\Desktop\ypw`.
2. Any similarly named project directory is out of scope.
3. If requested work is found outside `ypw`, it must be re-implemented inside `ypw` and never treated as delivery.
4. Validation/build/test results are considered valid only when executed inside `ypw`.
